/**
 * WHICH KEYS ARE OURS — a prefix rule plus a short explicit allowlist.
 *
 * A flat hardcoded list of all ~30 keys is the obvious implementation and a trap:
 * the next feature that calls `localStorage.setItem` silently falls out of every
 * backup taken afterwards and NOTHING fails — the export succeeds, the user gets
 * a .json, and the loss surfaces only during the restore that was meant to save
 * them. A prefix rule catches new keys by default, so the failure mode flips to
 * "a stray key gets backed up": costs bytes, nothing else.
 *
 * The key names are the ONE brand-specific thing in this brand-free slice — the
 * file cannot be correct without knowing them — so they are a default-valued
 * `rule` parameter, not a hardcoded constant, and a non-mso consumer passes its own.
 *
 * `mso:` / `mso.` are the current namespaces; `sv:` is the pre-rename one and is
 * STILL WRITTEN today (sv:dock, sv:shell, sv:profiles…) — renaming those keys
 * would have reset every existing user's dock and shell choice, so they stayed.
 * `alfa.` is the assistant store (skills / agents / automations).
 *
 * `extra` is for keys that predate any namespace and cannot be reached by a
 * prefix without also matching unrelated site data. Keep it short; a new key
 * should take a prefix instead of landing here.
